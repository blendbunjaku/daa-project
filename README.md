# Pathfinding – DAA Project
## React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Installation
1.	Clone repository to your local machine
2.	Open terminal and `cd` into repository folder
3.	Run `npm install`
4.  Run `vite` or `npm run dev`

## Available algorithms
- A* algorithm
- Dijkstra's algorithm

## Map Pathfinding Visualizer
>Controls
>>- Left button: Place start node
>>- Right button: Place end node

The end node must be placed within the shown radius. To start the visualization, press the Start Button or press Space. A playback feature is available after the algorithm ends. You can customize the settings of the animation in the Settings Sidebar. Try to keep the area radius only as large as you need it to be. Anything above 10km is considered experimental, if you run into performance issues, stop the animation and clear the path.
